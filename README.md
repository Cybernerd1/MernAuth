# 🔐 MernAuth — Full-Stack Authentication System with OTP Verification

**MernAuth** is a full-stack authentication system built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.  
This was my **first complete full-stack project**, focused on implementing **secure user authentication** with features like **OTP verification**, **hashed passwords**, and **JWT-based login sessions**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

MernAuth provides a production-grade authentication flow where users can:
- Register with an email and receive a **One-Time Password (OTP)** for verification.
- Log in securely after account verification.
- Enjoy protected routes powered by **JWT authentication**.
- Experience a smooth and modern UI built with **React + Tailwind CSS**.
